Very, very hard to move internally. You have to let you current manager know before you make a contact with the future Hiring managers. The toxic managers may block your move if you don’t play ball despite having good reviews.

"Apple","Software Engineer","Here are the bad things","Reviews are accurate, all of the bad ones at least. They use a lot of OFFSHORE contractors, and high percentage are not good, same for the managers, they used to be not so good contractors and are managers now.

Is not usually bad to use contractors due to the flexibility of scale up and down on people, but when you have 5 employees and 15 contractors and they just come and go, you don't really have that flexibility, it's the same 15 positions but filled but people that are taken to extreme burn out and writing code and creating designs worst than recent grads. Engineer quality is the worst I've ever seen in my life overall with 18 YOE. Are there good folks there? Yes, absolutely, but when you have 5 employees and 15 contractors and 50% suck and are OFFSHORE in India on a completely different timezone you are in for a mess and a career hara-kiri. 

Unless you are making much less than the current TC offered, I would advise against it. It doesn't matter the team, trust me on that, I have experienced and interacted with several teams, it's all the same. If TC is significantly higher take it, and leave soon to similar paying company. I'm looking for my way out.

All the contractors are from Tata Consulting and Infosys, those guys are suffering and being exploited. 100% of the people I've interacted with are Indians, diversity is 0%, it's incredible, you feel like you are in India yourself, never seem this in my life and I've worked in all the MAGAF.","Great pay, great benefits and you have Apple on your resume.","Apr 9, 2020","Former"

Swamped with 3rd party contractors, indian body-shop mostly, management treats them terribly. Rude, unprofessional and unethical work culture. Senior leadership within IS&T are terrible, egoistic megalomaniac, with zero leadership skills. They don't know how to lead by example.
- There is no place for engineers here in this group. Rampant politics and horrible work culture. Managers in this group are nothing but ""project managers"", who have no technical / engineering acumen, and have no eye towards architecture, code or good engineering practices. They treat engineers like second class citizens. These managers have no interest in career growth and development of their employees. All they care about is themselves and their RSU refreshers, appeasing their bosses anyway possible to get there.
- Most of the teams in IS&T build internal and corporate tools/applications. and they are dismal at that, from infrastructure to development processes, terrible..terrible !! You won't be working on anything world changing. 
- If you think you can change groups easily, you are sadly mistaken. It is very difficult to change groups/departments within Apple. You need to let your manager of your interest first, then go through the entire recruitment process, as if you are an external candidate, and if for whatever reason, you do not end up landing that new position, you would face extreme retaliation in your current team, your current manager would screw your career up. You would be ostracized, and he/she would make sure you have no future left in Apple. 
- IS&T has a bad reputation within apple, and every other group within apple treats IS&T folks that way. Other engineering groups are treated better. In short, apple has this subtle class-based culture. Not everyone is treated equally and respect.

If you are an engineer and thinking about joining Apple and IS&T assuming you would be able to do amazing engineering work, you are sadly mistaken. IS&T is the place where engineers come to destroy their career. My personal advice - Stay away from this group.","- Apple brand on resume if you care about these sort of superficial things.

"Apple","IOS App Reviewer","iOS App Reviewer - don't take this job.","This is not only an honest review of the App Reviewer position, but as many recent reviews here also a cry for help. This department is in shambles. The mixture of horrible management and a toxic environment that becomes worse and worse with every passing day is not sustainable. 
People reading these reviews might be confused as to why some are positive and some so negative. I will clarify that for you - look at the dates! Once upon a time working here was amazing. The previous director knew you by name and the team was very tight and close. We all worked hard but were also rewarded. More than anything there was a true sense of teamwork and community. You could rely on one another. Everyone was there to help each other no matter what their role in the department was. This is one of the most diverse departments in all of Apple and that used to be celebrated. People were happy and proud to work on that team and for each other. The older positive reviews are for the golden age of App Review. Unfortunately, those days are long long gone. 
So what happened? Management changes. And it’s been a free fall ever since. The new director put in is never there and just doesn’t care about his employees. His only concern since being put in this role has been the implementation of new tools that he created without ever having any kind of understanding or insight on how the reviewers do their jobs.
They started hiring people from AppleCare - arguably the worst department of Apple corporate. First it was the current operations manager who just has been hiring his cronies ever since. Instead of hiring from within with more than qualified candidates who also have a deep understanding and knowledge of the job function and where to improve he brings up his friends from AppleCare of his golf buddy. The managers that were with the department before have become spineless as their complaints fall on deaf ears too. Most just come in to work everyday to collect their paychecks and wait for their stocks to vest. The others have become so stressed out and take it out on reviewers by micromanaging every aspect of their time at work from what time you punch in to how long you take in the bathroom to checking your screens to see what you’re doing. Their unhappiness and helplessness trickles down to the already unhappy reviewers. 
Instead of being a united team this department is now filled with interoffice politics and drama. We no longer have fun events. we no longer have lunch provided. We work longer hours and significantly less flexible shifts. Reviewers are in fear of talking to each other and everyone is on edge. Other departments at Apple have figured this out and will not hire you from App Review. They dont want to touch us with a 10 foot pole. And so unless you decide to start sucking up with the head of operations you have no future in Apple in this department or otherwise. And trust me you do not want to be at a dead end job with this high of a work toxicity level. And if you still decide to take this job you cant say you weren’t warned.","For the time being this job comes with most of the full time benefits many other Apple employees get.","Jun 26, 2018","Current"

"Google","Software Engineer","Misogynistic. Toxic. Retaliatory.","Google is the most toxic place that I have ever worked. Everyone is obsessed with levels. Yet, levels are largely determined by personal connections and stereotypes. I found out after I started that some employees had spent years researching the hiring system to game it. My coworkers were all significantly less qualified than my peers at prior jobs. My recruiter did not understand anything on my resume and pointed out that it was very different than all the resumes that she saw from entry level men. She assumed that meant that I was less qualified than them and never considered that I was far more qualified. She kept saying things that were horrifically sexist. She attempted to route me towards a non-technical position even after I had passed the interview and gotten approval from the hiring committee. The hiring processes are set up such that the recruiters determine someone's level and the interviewers and hiring committee cannot fix a mistake no matter how glaring. This results in some employees being underleveled. Most experienced women are underleveled by at least one level, but some are underleveled by multiple levels. Other employees are overleveled. This results in an entirely toxic culture. The underleveled employees are wondering what's wrong with them that their entire careers suddenly evaporated. The overleveled employees are extremely insecure and resort to bullying the underleveled employees (mostly women and people of color) because they know that they're less qualified than the underleveled employees. Even the managers who recognize what's happening are unable to fix the problems because HR is more concerned with covering up the problem. As a result, underleveled employees are being given work far below their competence level (because HR won't allow them to get higher level work) and told that they have to prove themselves again.su","Money.

"Meta","Software Engineer","Horrible terrible company with worst culture","At Facebook I got to know what ""gaslighting"" really means. Gaslighting is exactly what is the culture that is imposed top-down by management. It starts at the bootcamp. There, you'll be properly brainwashed how cute and cuddly Facebook is, how unfairly it is being treated by everybody, how great and kind the Czar and his ruling gang is, and how grateful and privileged you (a despicable useless worm) should feel to be here! Right there, in the bootcamp, they will start the abusive treatment by telling you ""why on Earth did we hire you? You do not submit any code during last 24 hours!"" This abuse and fostering of your impostor syndrome will keep going on. Typical Facebook-style management is when you are being repeatedly told ""I have no idea how did you got here, and if how come you were not fired yesterday - but OK, we'll give you one more chance"".  This is part of this culture! 
There is a STACK RANKING! It's in tooling, in manager training materials! The fact that Facebook officially denies doing it is a yet-another confirmation that this company doesn't shy away from crime. Stack ranking means that all colleagues see each other as a competition. When I started my job at Facebook, my closest colleague didn't want to talk to me, because he knew that the better I succeed, the worse is for him. This is very profound and affects everybody: it's a hostile work environment. 
Performance reviews is a complete sham. There is one ""axis"" which is related to your actual performance. The other 3 (three!) axes (direction, etc.) is a complete baloney, and can be used to justify ANY rating for anyone. All managers are deeply ignorant schmoozers. 

Cult means there are plenty of taboo topics for which you'll be fired. There are, for example, internal ""non-managers"" groups, which are patrolled for any signs of dissent. If a person posts anything out of line there, this gets straight to his manager and HR. 
HR is the worst people I've met. They enforce the authoritarian rule ruthlessly and with cynicism. 

Working at Facebook has permanently damaged my faith in humanity. I realized that people can still do horrible crimes, given enough brainwashing. That people can treat each other like animals, given stack ranking.

"Meta","Data Engineer","Some adventures are not worth taking","1) the job I got is not the job I thought I was getting:
  As an engineer, with engineer in the title, and over 10 years of experience, I really thought I would get to do more engineering.  Unfortunately, the job is really about 50% business analyst and 20% project management, and 30% engineering.  You are expected to own every aspect of your project, regardless if anyone else actually does.  Also, you're told you have the opportunity to choose the team you want to be on, but for me, that choice was removed at the last minute.

2) bad management, bad leadership - all managers are expected to be individual contributors which is basically another way of saying that they aren't particularly good at either, and do not have time to devote to both roles.  Also, be prepared for mansplaining.

3) more money than sense:  gobs and gobs of money are being thrown around.  there's basically an offsite every other week.  Nevermind about work, deadlines, or being competent, it's more important to go glassblowing.  The pay is nice, in fact, its the best feature about the place.

4) the company that wants to connect the world would rather loose talent than have remote workers.  no, seriously.  say you're on a team, and your team decides to move to another office thats like 1 hour away.  you are kicked off the team and put on another team.  what sense does that make?  new mom wants to wfh?  not allowed. 
 Seriously, it's called skype, people.  

5) and speaking of teams, the team structure is completely whack.  instead of having a core group of people I work with on many projects, I have a different group of people I work with on each project.  a completely different set of swe, pm, ds, and de for each project.  This completely limits our ability to grow more efficient with each project, let alone build any sort of a professional relationship.

6) you're not allowed to fix things that are legit broken.  I've only been here a short time and have already had to suffer fools who prefer poorly designed metrics with political bs to actually measuring things properly.  bug 1 told not to fix it - too big to fail, bug 2, never got fixed by other team, bug 3, too high profile to fix.  seriously?  why not just admit all your metrics are wrong?

7) people care more about performance reviews than actual performance.  no really, if I hear the phrase make ""an impact"" I will vom.  What this really means is not ""do good and useful work"" which is how it might be interpreted, instead it means that you should very little on the very high profile projects, and then post it everywhere, to make sure people NOTICE.  Also, keep a log of your work so that you can share it with your absentee manager come review time - otherwise, he (yeah I said he) likely will have no idea what you worked on or why.  But, instead of this being a meaningful signal, it just becomes more noise.","free food, free t-shirts, free laundry, good pay.

This individual was not respectful of my mental health conditions and was downright insulting on a regular basis. I actually had started up a lawsuit against him and was told that my proof of his conduct wasn't admissible in court, which does not negate his guilt. After leaving I learned that he continued to bully his subordinates without consequence and was also rated the worst manager in IT just after he was promoted after being on the team for only 6 months. I was turned down for promotion multiple times due to the fact that I never had a manager who paid attention or cared about what I was doing. If my work didn't put this person on a stage, it wasn't important to him. He became buddies with the HR rep and that's when he made it all about me and said that I was the problem.

People tend to avoid direct confrontation and being nice in the first place, then you might find yourself backstabbed. Are there lots of politics? I've seen worse in other places. Lots of people pretend to be caring about core values, cultures, goodness but actually what they care might just be stock units and compensation.

"Spotify","Software Engineer","Worst Manager I've Ever Had","Working at Spotify was easily the nadir of my career.

My manager basically ignored all input from everyone on the team, and didn't do much of anything in terms of providing technical leadership, or helping me with my career growth. He clearly didn't care about how long projects took to complete. Ultimately, he retaliated against myself and two other members of my team after we submitted negative feedback about him during a performance review.

Spotify does just about everything possible to allow managers to retaliate against their direct reports. Feedback is not anonymized or obfuscated at all, and managers are able to read their feedback from their direct reports before writing evaluations for their direct reports.

Overall Spotify seems like it has a broad spectrum of experiences. Some teams and some managers are presumably great, and you would never have a problem with them. However, the bad managers are very bad, and they're not going anywhere. My advice for anyone thinking of accepting a position here is to make sure you know who you would be reporting to, and how they run their team. If you can, try to get some input from the ICs on that team as well.","Some of the internal tooling was fun to play around with if you're a music nerd.","Aug 6, 2020","Former"

Very rare to find a manager that cares about your personal career growth. It's 100% on you to manage it, which is fine so long as there is proper training, opportunities, and guidance as to how to do that. How do you drive your own development here when managers are hesitant to let you embed and your team's work/culture is slow, unexciting and lacking any real technical challenge?","Office views

"Spotify","Senior Engineer","Great leaders but rude and incentive people in teams","Note : this is based on the team I joined and the people around it, other teams might have completely other atmosphere.

I joined during covid, everything happened remotely. I resisted myself a lot to not think negatively because I thought it might be because of covid and things will improve over the time but frankly people are rude, people are insensitive, people are not welcoming to new people joining the team. 

They are very happy within themselves, not trying to include new people in discussions and don't even listen when I try to say something, so forget about understanding me or making me understand. There is no sense of belonging. 

Sometimes I feel very depressed oftenly. I know on one and no one know me. No one entertain to new joiners in my team, I never interacted with my product manager or the engineers in other guild in my team. In meetings they mostly talk in some code words and when I try to ask they simply ignore and move on. The groups of oldies hijacks every single meeting, they dont bother asking, listening in retros, groomings, plannings etc. I used to receive feedback form initially where I tried to share my feedback but now those forms also stopped coming after the manager left.
 
Social actives are physical (not remote friendly) people meet, enjoy (it was fine till here bcz their life) and shamelessly say in group chats (slack) for people working remotely, we don't care, which hurts sometimes, I feel so useless and meaningless. There is definitely discrimination.

This is remote first company but people, teams here are not at all remote friendly, not even friendly in general.

Sometimes music bands are visiting the office.","Jun 12, 2017","Current"
"Spotify","Senior Software Engineer","Developer at Spotify Stockholm","* Accountability: You will probably not be held accountable for anything you do as a dev (in most teams), unless it's terribly catastrophic. This is good if you're a junior developer and you're just starting in your field. You should not be afraid to ask questions, or fail. But it's a double-edge sword. You'll also not be rewarded for extra effort or achievement.

* Salary: Generally, other companies pay better. Spotify tends to pay engineers less than the national average and they often pride themselves for that. (The recruiters often say this openly to journalists and conferences. But it's a different story if you work in a US office.) If you're not from Sweden, some Spotify recruiters will try to sign you up with as little as they can get away with, but you should be able to negotiate a higher salary. Note that rents in Sweden are high; you should set aside 12-14k SEK for rent each month if you're moving to a furnished second-hand apartment.

* Salary Parity: Developers and QA are generally not paid according to skill or achievements, but negotiation skills. There are huge differences between developers of the same experience and achievement. Also, due to the fact that salary ranges are not published, it's impossible to negotiate properly. In addition to that, there are huge differences depending on the teams that are politically better e.g. a mobile dev will get less than an analytics dev, irrespective of their achievements or experience. QAs tend to get less than developers, and design and product tend to get way more.

* Stock Options: The stock options program at Spotify is quite limited and you get an insignificant fraction of the available options. You also get taxed quite heavily; the Swedish state will get at least 52% on the price difference, before you even sell them (profit is calculated on converting the options to shares). Taxes are much lower if you work for a small company (with fewer than 300 employees).

* Personal Growth: If you're looking to grow your skills beyond development, Spotify can be tricky. The opportunities you get depend on the people you work under, and the tech org structure side you're on. There is no definite programme or structure setup to allow for growth; you will probably need to push and prod (and sometimes fight) with some of your superiors in order to get more training.

* Lack of Training and Development: Spotify does internal training only, and it's limited to some soft skills. If you want to attend an external course, even if it will help you do your job better, Spotify will not support you in any way with that.

* Management: Despite the company's efforts, management is a mixed bag. There are good and bad managers, and they don't really get evaluated so much. There is no structured feedback for your immediate manager; if you have a bad one, you might be stuck with her/him for a while.

* Attitudes Towards Developers: There is an underlying attitude by the leaders of the company that developers are replaceable, and that seniority or experience doesn't really matter. The company's recruitment efforts can be summed up as ""we need more warm bodies fast to write the code"". HR makes zero effort to make Spotify attractive to senior developers, and often people don't stay longer that 3-4 years.

* No Way Up for Senior Developers: There is no way up for developers. If you want to grow upwards as a developer, and not become a manager somehow, you're out of luck. There is only one level for developers, and maybe you can call yourself ""Senior"" in your LinkedIn profile, if you've stayed with the company for several years.

* Slow Pace of Change: The tech work environment doesn't change very much. Despite the fact that there are several well-known problems in how we work, inc. those mentioned above, the tech leadership is loath to make real changes and when they do, it takes them forever to implement them.

* Scrum Micromanagement: If taken to extremes, Scrum can be as heavy as waterfall. There are teams at Spotify that micromanage every little task and the bureaucracy around little things can be frustrating. There is also an open question, if such teams are reaping any benefits from Scrum.","A developer position at Spotify may be good for you or not, depending on what's important to you, and at what point you are in your career. There a lot of good things about Spotify, and there's plenty of bad things too. I try to be honest and objective in my review. A note of warning: what I write are not absolute truths; all these depend on the team you work on, or the manager you have, or the recruiter you meet. Those can make a huge difference in your day-to-day work experience.


The good:

* Relaxed Work Environment: Spotify has a very relaxed work environment. Failure is tolerated and even embraced. You will not be penalized for mistakes; you'll be encouraged to learn from them, to become better and avoid them in the future.

* Great Product: Spotifiers take a lot of pride in creating value for the customer, improving people's lives, and making the world better through music. Most people live this mentality and it is encouraged throught the company by the leadership. Each person works hard to create a product with high quality and attention to detail.

* Great Colleagues: Generally, the bar is quite high at Spotify. Spotify strives to hire people that are excellent in their field, and above the bar for their level. They also try to hire good people, not just great developers. 

* Social Life: You will probably attend a lot of great parties at Spotify and many events with visiting artists. There are great Summer and Christmas parties every year, and after-works every two weeks. The Social Team organizes trips and activities all year round, so there is always something to do, and it's easy to get a social life if you're new in Sweden.

* Brand Name: If you have work experience at Spotify, it's a huge asset in your CV, especially in Sweden. Recruiters go nuts for Spotify people on LinkedIn. (This might not be so great some times.)

* Diversity: Spotify pays a lot of attention to diversity, and they try to hire and promote women in tech. Everybody gets diversity training when they start. Spotify isn't perfect, but they're trying really hard to be on par or better that the tech industry in that.

* Learning: Spotify is a challenging environment where the bar is set quite high. When I first joined I realized that I was playing at completely different level of competence and had to up my game. I learned a lot through that, and with a lot of help from my colleagues.

* Work/Life Balance: Nobody will ask you to work overtime, without any significant reason. The company wants you to have a balance between your work and private life, and your manager will help you keep it.","Sep 24, 2016","Current"

- Teams are chasing metrics with their portion of the Spotify app. This comes at the expense of the holistic user experience, which has degraded quite a bit IMO.
- Promotion policy is a bit heavy-weight, especially at the Staff level. It's better to just apply and interview externally at that point. There seems to be no transparency or avenue for feedback on packages. It's also significantly easier to get hired as a Staff engineer than to be promoted to one.
- The culture seems to have taken a hit ever since the company went public. This makes sense, as they are beholden to the shareholders.
- Compensation needs to be re-evaluated. Equity refreshers do not happen unless you are promoted or explicitly asked about. Cost of living increase is also well below inflation.","- Great work-life balance. Spotify really does care about your wellbeing. They were very responsive to the Covid Pandemic and were ahead of a lot of other tech companies in creating a WFH policy.
- Intro-days was a great benefit. Hopefully they do bring back in person Intro-Days in the future, as it was fun to go to Sweden to see the leadership team in person
- You are encouraged to grow and learn new skills. There are plenty of opportunities to learn new skills internally, primarily through TechU courses. I've been a huge fan and do encourage co-workers to utilize this benefit

I've been a part of several reorgs over the past year. I read that before I started and thought it couldn't be that bad but it can really affect you ability to grow in your career if your manager or skip level keeps changing.
I've had two coworkers at the company who have left or were terminated because of bad managers. The quality of manager to manager can vary greatly. I suppose that's always the case but it's disappointing when there is no recourse.","Autonomy in day to day tasks, laid back culture, good work life balance","Feb 25, 2022","Current"
"Spotify","Senior Data Engineer","Be careful what team you get placed on","Be really careful what team you get placed on when you start. I got placed into the Financial Engineering org, which operates separately from the rest of the engineering organization. It's much closer to working at a bank than a traditional software engineering organization. Deadlines are very much done in the ""waterfall"" model you see in banks, rather than a normal agile sprint organization. Engineering is seen mostly as a cost center function to support financial analysts, and there's very little room for product feedback or creative input from the engineering function.

As for the overall direction of the company I didn't really get it. I love the music product, but the podcast product is really terrible and is dragging down the rest of the product. All of the all-hands are the company leadership apologizing for terrible things Joe Rogan says. It's just not a place I felt proud of anymore.","- Salary was pretty good

"Spotify","Software Engineer","Lack of motivation and unfulfilling work","With great wlb and autonomy comes some seriously unmotivated employees who take forever to get anything done. Maybe it's because the hiring bar has seriously lowered or maybe it's because there's no bonus structure combined with the fact that Spotify will probably not fire you as long as you push some code and are a fun/nice person. 

Regardless, at some point, you're going to realize you spend 40 hours a week at work and would like to spend most of it NOT trying to motivate underperforming teammates to actually code and NOT deal with process heavy and debilitating consensus-driven product decisions that get trashed in 6 months because you're re-orged to some other part of the company.

Spotify is honestly great if you're a parent or just want to coast because they expect so little from you. That said, if you're ambitious and find satisfaction from actually building great products with hardworking and innovative teammates I'd refrain from coming here.","Great work-life balance.

"Spotify","Engineer","Good for entry-level positions. Not so good for experienced engineers","Spotify leaves a lot to be desired in a few areas:

* HR is highly inefficient, and despite its supposedly progressive policies, it rarely aligns with the interest of allowing people to do the best of their work, and mostly serves the purpose of protecting the management of the organization. On the other hand, as far as you never have to deal with HR, they won't get in your way. 

* Interviewing with the company is a true nightmare, both for interviewees and interviewers. Nobody seems to believe the way we interview and handle candidates is efficient at all, but we keep doing the same, while losing good people in the process.

* The company is surprisingly vertical and hierarchical. Too much power is given to leads and middle managers, to the point that entire structures depend on single managers to exist, and when they leave the company (which happens quite often), their organizations fall apart leaving dozens of people in the limbo.

* Managers are usually not experienced (being managers for the first or second time in their careers). The incentive for them to be managers is related to the pay grade and visibility, as opposed to what they are actually looking for to grow professionally.

* Most product owners are failed technical people who want to grow their careers by going vertical, incentivized by the low pay in the engineering side. They frequently believe that they are managers of some sort, and don't really understand what it takes to implement products.

* It doesn't pay well, scoring in the 70-80% of the market average. This is a major hurdle and stops experienced people to either come, or to stay in the organization. Engineers only afford to be underpaid for a couple years before leaving, and the ones who stay only do so because they are not competitive in the market, or because they are locked in due to stock options or visa constraints. Pay reviews can only happen once a year, through a process that is arbitrary and disconnected from actual performance and workers' market value, as pay raises are capped by HR.

* From the moment you enter the organization until the day you leave it, you are going to be dragged into an seemingly infinite amount of pointless meetings that will consume at least 50% of your time. That seems to be a fundamental part of the culture in the organization, in which everything has to be agreed and communicated on; except that this is rarely the case as managers keep to themselves what's truly important, and collective decisions are just a way to rubber-stamp decisions that have been already made. Engineers keep pointing out that this is a major issue productivity-wise, but management does nothing to stop it.

* Engineers are incentivized to prioritize work outside of their teams instead of delivering for their teams due to the way levels and promotions work. This contributes to more meetings, documents, politics and perception-based work as opposed to technical innovation.

* Do not expect to grow your career at Spotify. You'll stick to your role, level and salary during your stay there. The company truly prefers to hire new people to fill positions (even though most of the time those people have no better experience than existing employees) as opposed to promote their own people.

"Spotify","Engineering Manager","Consumer BU","The tech, especially in Consumer BU, is full of custom-built locally optimized legacy decisions. Spotify can't get ahead of its legacy tech because decisions made today are still short-sighted, immature and unscalable. This is a result of 2 historical facets that haven't changed enough as the company grew:

1. Cross-functional autonomous teams: These teams are supposed to be self-sufficient units and are bound to become silos that make technology decisions that only suit themselves. Spotify's products reflect the org structure. The inconsistencies in the consumer experience across the various apps is unparalleled in consumer tech - you even get different search results for the same query on different apps. Each of these apps might as well have been made by different companies. This has historically prevented platform-thinking. Every app is an unnecessarily different clone of the same functionality, even if it could have been built using the same reusable technologies. This is unfortunately not improving either.

2. Chapter Leads: To promote cross-team collaboration and alignment, Spotify had Chapter Leads - people managers with reports from different teams. In reality, this created a gaping hole in technical leadership that could have prevented the misguided decision-making. The focus on leadership at Spotify is disproportionately on people management and woolly leadership qualities versus technical expertise, systems thinking and delivery management. This hasn't changed even as the company has moved toward replacing Chapter Leads with Engineering Managers.

While you will hear a lot of harp about diversity, inclusion and belonging, a lot of the leadership actually enforces conformism to vague ideals and behaviours while acting like a cool boys club. Many business decisions are taken over after-hours private conversations between old-timer white often Swedish males and then dictated top-down. Every so often, a mail forwarded from leadership is in Swedish. While these can be easily translated, this is symptomatic of a bigger problem.

The conformism wipes out any diversity of thought or ideas. It has often been witnessed that radical ideas (like building reusable scalable platforms) are suppressed until the cool boys club sees merit in them and then they are dictated top-down without any credit to the people who had been harping about it for so long. Most of the constructive or critical feedback you'll get is about how to conform, not about your technical solutions, productivity or impact. Unless you're at the beginning of your career, you'll learn very little from your manager and peers. For the years I've been here, I've never been able to shake off the feeling of being an outsider.

Because things aren't built to plug into a larger system and be reusable across products, reinvention of the wheel has become an internal joke.","Great relocation and benefits, especially for parents

"Spotify","Mobile Engineer","All is truth - both good and bad","All said here is true as well:

 - Salary: It is average for the Swedish market, which means you will find similar offers elsewhere
 - Career advancement: A lot of buzzwords, process and manuals designed to obfuscate performance evaluation. The bottom line is this: If you want to advance your career at Spotify, be sure to do lots of self-promotion, and don't disagree with your managers. Even then, though, Spotify will rather hire someone from the outside, rather than promote you.
 - Management: As a consequence from the above, lots of managers aren't the best or the smartest, but the loudest and flashiest. As such, lots of the decisions they make are aimed at looking good, at the expense of product quality and engineering teams.  This is particularly true for Product managers at Spotify, who in practice act as ruling party.
 - Passive-agressive politics: Teams do not coordinate, and try to avoid each other in the race for getting their own thing done. This leads to chaos, aimless re-orgs and routine passive-aggressive communication.
 - Dogmatism: For a company that preaches openness and selfless behavior, there is a lot of cult of personality towards key figures, and lots of empty self-pride in lots of the processes and models created by the company, which leads to them being thought of as unquestionable truths.
 - Fear of failure: Failure is swept under the rug, and cannot be discussed openly, otherwise you will become an outcast, while middle managers get promoted for posturing while the company flounders.

However, the biggest con is Tech:
Tech at Spotify is trailing miserably, at least in Mobile, strangled by a bunch of internal ""wheel-reinvented"" tools that impair innovation and adopting the most recent industry standards for technology. If you like doing new stuff with antique tools, and filled with lots of cumbersome, Spotify-only systems, look no further.","Basically all you can read here is true:

 -  Lots of free food, I have lost weight since leaving.
 - Smart and friendly co-workers
 - Several learning/training opportunities
 - CV Booster: Everyone is excited to hear you worked at Spotify
 - Good work-life balance, although that is more a Sweden thing than a Spotify thing.","Jun 30, 2019","Former"
"Spotify","Senior Engineer","Sounds sexier than it is","If you are not in the main offices (Stockholm or New York) many benefits are not available to you or only after extensive begging. It took several years for Swedish to be offered to foreign employees in the Gothenburg office and even then it was only through a conference call, not on site. Many discounts or special deals (e.g. with banks) are also only available in shops around the major offices, which means employees in the other offices are often left out. 

The time between the official announcement of a promotion and the time when it's registered in the HR system can take up to four months, during which of course the question of a potential salary bump is neatly avoided. I have yet to receive a good explanation why it takes so long or why the company is loath to discuss salary increases for people it deems worthy of promotions. 

The stock options are laughable. Permanent employees do not get many when they join and stock options are granted for exceptional performance, not RSUs, which means you first have to pay for the privilege of getting at the shares. In Sweden you can even pay taxes of up to 90% (e.g. cashless exercise or same-day sale), which means the options are mostly a gift for the government.

There is somewhat of a frat house culture, which is considered ""playful"", one of the company's values. This translates into pinball machines, nerf guns, hoverboards, free snacks and drinks, many office parties, ping-pong and billiards tables, Fridays where people walk around in bunny/unicorn/squirrel costumes and drink beer or wine in the afternoon, board games coming out of your ears, Mario Kart competitions, and the likes. The relaxed environment is definitely nice and a big plus. The ""playfulness"" is for some people a major bonus, while for others it feels silly or yet another way to keep people in the office longer. For those who don't participate, it's an easy way to be excluded and being labelled ""not fun"".

Office parties encourage employees to bring along their friends and families. The same goes for sports events. While some love to socialize with colleagues outside of work, that's definitely not for everyone. Again, while it can promote togetherness, it also causes cliques to be formed. The lack of clear boundaries can also be a fast track to burn-out, although most employees are too young to have experienced (or care about it), or they do not mind melding work and their private lives.

Diversity and inclusion are major threads running through the company. A good initiative that's hampered by the idea that inclusion and equality stop at gender and sexuality, but mostly gender. People with a different personality who differ from the norm are often treated as outcasts, especially if these people do not participate in the many social events (outside of work hours). I doubt that happens on purpose, but it definitely happens. While that's to be expected, there have been occasions in which a manager called out a person (an engineer) for not smiling enough. The reason was that others thought the person was perceived to be intimidating by not having a friendly face. There are also not too many people over the age of 35-40 within the company, especially in engineering roles.

Email threads with several dozen or even a hundred people who all hit ""Reply All"" are very common, especially when congratulating people on promotions or when people join the company. Fortunately, you can mute those conversations when they arrive but they are still annoying as they clog up your inbox. The same is true of mutual appreciation email threads. While it could be said such emails are to keep people informed and ""celebrate wins"", they usually only show that the group of included people was too large or that the bar for ""celebrations"" was really low. Hardly a thread goes by without a GIF or meme.

""Lunch and Learn"" sessions are terrible. Yes, the company pays for the lunch, which for some people is the sole reason to show up. But it's also a way to keep on working when you should really be resting your mind. In a sense, it's also insulting to the speaker who cannot eat during the usual lunch hour but has to talk to a group of people who are masticating and listening with half an ear.

Let's not beat about the bush: middle management is incompetent. Apart from sitting in meetings most of the day, there is not a lot they achieve, if anything. Most employees have half an hour every other week when they talk to their superior in a one-on-one. Those times tend to be eaten up with inane questions about projects the managers have no real idea about but heard mentioned in a meeting by someone else. Furthermore, it's not uncommon these sessions are cancelled on short notice due to managers being too busy or away at another office. I have had three different managers in my time at Spotify and not one of my superiors had a notebook (or laptop) with them for jotting down notes during such a 1:1. If a piece of paper was needed, the room's post-its and Sharpies were used for that. There is hardly ever any follow-up because, well, I guess, they forget where they stuck the post-its after the meeting.

The same goes for agile coaches. The company has dozens of them in most larger offices. What they do I don't know. They sometimes facilitate a retrospective for a team, but other than that they seem to be evangelists of productivity fads, such as the pomodoro technique.

Every six months employees need to ask feedback from their coworkers, which as far as I have been able to determine is only because otherwise the managers have no idea of their underlings' achievements or performance. They are not involved in the ""squad"" (i.e. team) work and there is typically a product manager per team who does the day-to-day prioritization and stakeholder management, although the latter tends to be outsourced to employees too. The feedback is (as is to be expected when asking peers) fuzzy at best. People obviously don't take notes about their coworkers, so it's often a five-minute rehash of what they can remember from the past week or so, watered down by the fact that no one wants to go on record saying their colleague is a complete jerk.

The feedback is not used as a means to cause changes in behaviour as that's left to the employee to decide whether they want to. While that's good as it leaves the employee in question in charge of their own (professional) development, it's also very loose, leading to no real change whatsoever. It mostly feels like an exercise in futility. You are required to fill in a sheet with accomplishments ahead of time, so that your manager can see what you did. It's also hard to accept the advice of a manager when that same manager hasn't the slightest idea what you did and whether you did it well - nor the means necessary to make such an assessment. Employees who do the work without making a big fuss about it often get short-changed: self-promotion is the way to make sure you're seen as a high performer, whether you actually did the work or not.

Every year there is a reorganization within R&D, not because there is a specific need that needs to be addressed, but because it's reorg season. In most cases, these reorgs amount to nothing more than relabelling departments and shuffling a handful of people around. In the years I've been at the company I've seen a reorg every single year without having seen any tangible benefits. I understand there is no single organizational structure that solves all problems, but the rationale for reorgs is often lacking or at the very least not entirely clear. Even after several years it's opaque how decisions are made. Data-driven decision-making is a lie.

One of the key insight is that although Spotify started off as a music streaming company, the actual work has very little to do with music for the overwhelming majority of engineers. Don't be fooled into thinking the company has a flat hierarchy either. From a regular engineer up to the C-suite are 5-6 people in some departments. That's not to say the company is overly focused on processes, although that's starting to increase as it grows (up).","Spotify has a solid engineering culture. With roughly 1,000 engineers around the globe (though mostly in Stockholm and NYC) there is a lot of internal tooling, which is sometimes hard to debug: the documentation is not always great and there is no help outside of the company. However, the overwhelming majority of the engineers are extremely helpful and spend their time generously helping you debug issues with the internal infrastructure, although the situation has improved as the tooling has matured.

There are several standardized guides for different disciplines: mobile development, back-end engineering, data engineering, data science, and a few others. These are especially good for newcomers as these allow you to get up and running within a few hours.

Hack days (2 per month) and an R&D-wide hack week (5 day per annum) are great. These days allow you work on whatever project you wish, so it's great for learning new programming languages, reading up on research, trying out a new framework, or even work on crazy ideas. Annual hack weeks are a major event where all of R&D spends a whole week working on non-work things. There are daily breakfasts, fikas (Swedish cake time), and various events in the office, including a party on Friday to conclude and celebrate hack week.

Conference week is another annual event, where different ""chapters"" (disciplines) hold their internal (un-)conferences. This means most of R&D flies across the globe for a week of showing off what's new in the infrastructure and what tools are available or being developed. There are also annual off-sites, where an entire ""tribe"" (department) comes together at a non-office location. Most of these off-sites tend to be about socializing as there are often about 100 people or so. Most employees seem to enjoy networking with beers at a fancy location, while a few see it for what it is: a colossal waste of time, especially personal time: you have to travel several hours back and forth to spend 24 hours a day with your peers for no other reason than to listen to a few strategy talks, unconference sessions (i.e. discussions that do not need to have any clear outcomes), and eating/drinking. After about two days, the event is over. If you like trips, these are all great. If you prefer to stick to business and keep travel to a minimum because of other commitments or interests, not so much.

It's great that every employee can choose the laptop they want and you get a fancy desk that can be moved up and down for standing up or sitting down. Any gear you need to be productive or comfortable is usually a simple request from your boss and a click away. It's a no-fuss attitude to whatever people need for their work. Please note that the office areas are not exactly quiet or private, especially in the larger offices. The idea is that an open office plan fosters collaboration, but it's really because it's cheaper and the company is growing like mad.

Intro days are a three-day event where hundreds of newcomers flock to Stockholm to listen to talks from the CXOs and VPs about the company. It is a great way to introduce people to the company. The same goes for town halls, where the entire company is invited to listen on the latest updates from the executives.

Most offices are fairly easy when it comes to working from home. In most cases you inform your team about it and that's it. As long as the work gets done and you don't work from home every day of the week, it's all right. You're free to come and go as you please as you don't have to clock in/out.

In many offices there is sometimes music playing in all areas, not just the reception or central bits. While this is great in theory, it's not always conducive to quality work, especially when people play ""Pink Fluffy Unicorns Dancing on Rainbows"" or a sequence of 8-bit versions of 80s power ballads. Headphones are definitely a must on those days. Again, when you join you get a pair of headphones, so you're at least covered there.","Feb 18, 2019","Former"

"Twitter","Senior Software Engineer","A company that has lost it's way","- Execs and senior management have no freaking clue where to lead the company. The executive team has seen almost 100% turnover in the last year -- there is now literally a different group of people leading the company. Most executives and managers are young and are in high level leadership positions for the first time in their careers, and predictably have no idea what they're doing. 

- There is no legitimate product strategy for user growth and retention, other than unfounded optimism that something might happen. Good ideas appear every hack week, but none of them make it into the product. Teams are encouraged to A/B test everything and have to show overwhelmingly positive metrics to ship to 100%, even for the most common sense stuff. This all results in a mediocre product that doesn't change and shows no forward progress. 

- Career growth as an engineer is very difficult. Getting a promotion involves excessive groveling to higher-ranked engineers who are not incentivized to help anyone besides themselves grow. The title you get when you join the company will probably be the title you have when you leave.","- Great pay and benefits. Office is super nice, free lunches are great, massage rooms, exercise rooms, places to nap, meditate, etc.

"Twitter","Senior Software Engineer","No trust, no respect","There is a very narrow view of what is important in an engineer.

They are just constantly criticized for not matching some idealized model of the ""perfect engineer"".

From doing ""feedback"" for other organizations I know they have a similar process, where it's more about tearing people down than celebrating their contributions.

People are leaving every day, and it's not because their stock vested. People who are happy with what they do and feel appreciated do not not leave, people leave when they are unhappy.

- Too much hierarchy, sometime you will have to think twice before approaching other engineer

- Keep fixing bugs or small feature portrayed as big thing as millions of user affected but agility is lost, as a engineer will not get job satisfaction. 

- Following is my experience in my team: Senior will show attitude, will not speak in person and communicate only online, which in a way block your work.

- Code review system which require senior to approve your code will block you many time. Senior engineers will want you to implement things their own way, so you become just somebody's logic implementor.

- NOT a team oriented environment, people are driven by individual contribution metrics, therefore you will see sometime seniors are not that collaborative. Again this depends on which team you are working with though. but this is happening and have seen other people suffering from it.

- Didn't find middle management as employee friendly, my manager just talked to senior only.

- Advice to not a senior engineer: you may be just dictated by manager, senior engineer, you may be just implementor, and will be lost under big hierarchy. So make sure before joining a team you know the team and people you will be working with.","- Good food

"Twitter","Senior Software Engineer","Purges, Reorgs, and Cronyism Ruin Culture","- new products and features often don't ship
- not a meritocracy

After the IPO there were a lot of high-level firings, and each of those induced a re-org and blew away the product and feature development that occurred underneath. So, a lot of times yo'd see a feature developed, then abandoned or delayed, then attempted again six months later by another team.

On acquihires, problems arise when there's an obvious conflict of interest (e.g. someone high in the company is old pal's with the acquihired company's CEO), when good people are displaced and/or fired to make room for acquihired folk, and when acquihired folk parachute into the org with outsized titles and compensation, screwing over everyone who came in the front door and who had been working honestly. Tolerance and encouragement of this sort of cronyism is destructive not just to rank-and-file employees but to all shareholders.

Twitter presents itself externally as this hyper-ethical company super-concerned with noble ideas like user safety, but on the inside odd things happen, like a time a bunch of employees were fired with no notice and the survivors were told they could not ask questions and that no explanation would be given.

Given these conditions, employees are incentivized to leave the company as soon as they vest some stock and the learning slows, which happens at the two year mark, on average.","- smart coworkers

Good luck trying to focus in one of the worst open floor plan offices I have ever worked in. Row after row of bench style desks where stretching your arms might mean an awkward apology to the coworkers sitting on either side of you less than 3 feet away. They typically cram 50-100 people in a given area with no barriers, not even half walls, so you spend the majority of your working day trying to drown out the distractions.

Management is unprofessional and frequently in a position just one level higher than they should be. There is no coherent vision for the company except ignore what's best for the users if it means money can be made.

Finally, there's a reason why Twitter reported the worst representation of women in technical roles (90% male, 10% female). This place is a brogrammer haven. As a woman your faced with a culture that screams petulant college bro from the first day you walk through the doors. Women are frequently given work of lesser importance, have their ideas attributed their male colleagues, are passed up for promotions, and generally made to feel unwelcome. To top it off the women's organizations within Twitter carry no real weight at the company. They are open to all employees so women don't have a safe place to talk about the serious issues facing them without it being made into some kind of joke by male engineers or used against them later.","The perks are amazing including the food, unlimited PTO, medical/dental/vision, gym reimbursement, celebrity visits, and overall compensation package.

"Twitter","SRE","Addenda to an earlier review","Working in SRE has some serious issues.  There is an embedded approach -- so one gets one's work assignments and performance assessments from an engineering organization, but promotion/compensation decisions are made by SRE management.  It depends on how engaged the SRE management is with the SRE, and some SRE managers are extremely disengaged, or are willing to accept the word of the engineering manager.  The engineering manager does not have any incentive to promote the work of the SRE, particularly when the work is a joint project with engineering.  Similarly, engineering managers will be more focused on the work of their direct reports, and rightly so.  

This makes the entire SRE employee review process capricious.  Strong SREs are more readily lost through bad management, and SRE reviews (conducted entirely within SRE management structure) are more prone to second hand information and favoritism.","I have nothing to add from my previous comments, but this requires twenty words, so I need to add them.","Jul 7, 2014","Former"

a) It hard to find ""stunning collages"" because hiring is broken. If you are good at talking, and repeating culture jargon in the interview, you can easily get it. You can look in LinkedIn to see the qualification, background and education level of our engineers. Many engineers here are from bodyshop Indian IT firms (the likes of Infosys, TCS etc), who came onsite and simply switched to Netflix - because they can TALK. 

b) Informed captions (mostly managers) are technically incompetent and has no clue on making any informed data driven decisions. Decisions are heavily driven by politics. 

c) The whole push of open and honest feedback is just a sham to make things look good. Providing critical feedback is impossible here, as it mostly backfires and results into getting fired. So people just keep providing rosy feedback. 

d) If you were hired into a bad team or don't like the work, it is very very hard to switch teams. Even if some other manager is willing to take you in their team, the current manager usually retaliates by triggering keeper test and you get fired. Essentially your manager tells the new hiring manager that this person was bad performer so switching team to not get fired. 

e) There is no career growth for ICs here, everyone has the same title and level. However, on management there is clear growth path - double standards.","Pay is great

"Netflix","Senior Software Engineer","Fear-based culture","Fear-based, highly competitive culture driven by upper management. Mid-management is forced to follow the suit otherwise it will be their job on the line. Everyone is under pressure to deliver but nobody provides guidance as to what is expected. If you're a super-star you're supposed to figure it out on your own.
Zero tolerance to even small mistakes - you're expected to work as a perfect robot. If you made a mistake you're out immediately, no chance for correction.
Zero communications about your performance - it is all up to management to decide how you're doing. So you don't know whether you made or making mistakes.
Project management does not exist, hence no planning is happening, just loose email exchanges.
You don't feel as part of the team, there are virtually no teams, just people trying to prove something and keep their jobs. As a result many decisions are short-sited since they provide immediate credit, long-term decisions are usually on back-burner until all of a sudden they become critical and then it is all hands on deck.
You're expected to work long hours  and weekends on regular basis.
Basically if you accepted an offer you're owned by Netflix.

"Netflix","Senior Software Engineer","Like a good drama: A flashy young company in a nice setting, but with lots of tension under the surface","Netflix makes a big deal about their hiring policies. They claim that they regularly evaluate employee performance, and let the lowest performers go. To me, this sounded great! In contrast to many other companies where lazy and incompetent people hang around for years, Netflix tried to retain only the best and brightest people.

Unfortunately, that's not what it was like in reality. A week after I started at Netflix, the recruiter who hired me was unceremoniously dismissed. Then the tech support guy in our office was released. Then an engineer on my team. In each of these cases, it wasn't clear what these folks had done wrong. They had all been technically competent, friendly and hard working. This promoted a culture of fear where no one felt that their job was secure.

It turns out that there were several things going on. Managers were given incentives to regularly purge employees. So, managers developed antagonistic relationships with employees. In most normal companies, a key responsibility of a manager is to defend their team in front of senior management. At Netflix, this just doesn't happen.

Additionally, Netflix doesn't have adequate mechanisms for providing feedback and review to employees. (In the year I spent at Netflix, I didn't receive a single review, positive or negative.) Without a formal system for employee evaluation, managers resort to picking favorites: they hire in their friends, and fire people who they aren't friends with. I saw this happen to many different people while I was at Netflix. It's allowable by law (everyone is an ""at will"" employee), but it does not lead Netflix to hire and retain the best people.

Netflix has had the good fortune to be in an easy business. They moved early into online DVD rentals, and have large cost advantages over potential rivals. Their competitors (Blockbuster, Walmart, etc) took major missteps, and were not really able to compete. Netflix doesn't have to be the best at anything they do: operations, marketing, movie recommendations, etc. They just have to be OK at these things to run a profitable business, and they are only OK at them.","Netflix has nice, fancy offices in Los Gatos.

"Netflix","Senior Software Engineer","Lost their way","- freedom and responsbility is their mantra when you're hired, but it is not practiced by new managers.
- people get fired all the time for disagreeing or questioning management on anything.

- even star performers routinely get the axe.  Others remaining are understandably nervous about their jobs.
- so called stock plan makes no sense at all.  Only plan I've ever heard of where an employee has to risk his own money to participate.
- benefits are awful if you have a family.  It cost me $800/month to have medical and dental for the family of 4.  If your single, your completely covered.
- no vacation paid when you leave.  This is also a plus in a way though.  Netflix does not track vacation time at all.  If you take too much though, you will get fired without warning.","- top of market base salary

"Netflix","Senior Software Engineer","Highly Political Company with Mediocre Middle-Management","There is a great deal of politics between Engineering orgs and even within engineering teams. Even with obviously outstanding performance, failing to play politics well will leave you unrewarded, while others with more political savvy will be rewarded for no work at all. Ultimately, the manager is free to be biased for/against employees for any reason at all.

Engineering managers in some orgs tend to be non-technical--only doing project management. Although some non-technical managers might still be good managers, there are some that are horrible, with poor project management skills, and that don't even know what is happening in their own team. Those managers tend to be employed at Netflix for many years.

There is no career development support here. It's unlikely that the current management will do any more as new (lower) engineering levels are added.

As for the 360 review, it's best to avoid giving significant negative feedback as it makes co-workers defensive. Everyone is afraid of anything negative that can lead to them being fired. HR and management advice on 360 reviews is unrealistic and self-serving. It only helps management since some managers don't know what's happening on their own teams.

Ultimately, Netflix is a large company where experiences will differ, depending on which team and organization you work in. If you change teams or managers a few times, though, you'll encounter highly toxic situations.

For new mid-level prospective employees, avoid Netflix since the lower pay is likely not worth the extreme politics and toxicity.","The pay when all engineers were senior engineers was higher than most other companies.

* They claim it is all rockstar engineers and the fire who are not but I have seen ppl surviving for ages not even knowing what they did for all these years at Netflix and they are pure mediocre engineers.
* My advice to engineers would be if you are happy with the work what you are doing right now or with other offers in hand, don't fall for the salary trap, it is merely an illusion.","* Best place if you just want to work with great technically capable folks.
* 15-20% higher pay but if you actually consider everything, it might not be that big of a deal. Check what will be in-hand salary after taxes because taxes also go high with salary.
* Somewhat transparent workplace but at times higher management takes ridiculous decisions like Quickster, what the hell....
* Reed gets thing right most of the time (except Quickster) and understand what he is doing.","Mar 15, 2013","Current"
"Netflix","Senior Software Engineer","Revisiting my review after working here for a while. There are better, rewarding careers out there.","I was sold on all the culture stuff  and drank the cool-aid at first. After spending a lot f time at Netflix, my perspective has changed for the worse. What good is the sales pitch if you can't deliver. 

Some organizations are terrible (i am not talking about IT/ back-office type group) when it comes to  recognizing people, allowing (forget about encouraging) their growth. No carrer, no recognition. In a way, its a career dead-end. Its a JOB.

Recent break-neck hiring has bought in a TON of managers (e.g. instead of bringing in 1 project manager, they've hired >1 managers). Believe it or not, it takes 4 times the amount of meetings (compared to 2 years ago at Netflix) to get 1/2 of what we used to get done in the same period of time.

Today, all of the talk about culture (except firing people for no good reason), freedom etc are just BS.

No family insurance (medical, dental etc). Company only pays for the employee but in reality, they don't care.","It's a decent JOB (emphasis on purpose) if you are looking for a heads down, monotonous coding job. If you can manage a decent amount of work and the perspective, you will have a stable pay check.","Nov 23, 2011","Current"
"Netflix","Senior Software Engineer","Earn big bucks and get fired","They'll fire you when they feel like it, regardless of performance.

Netflix recruiters will spend enormous hours luring you from a company you're happy in yet after you get in you'll be disappointed. Huge paycheck (Negotiate! They'll fall in!) is their only retention policy after that. Ah, and forget about your carrer, once you join Netflix it's over until you're out.","Making big bucks and taking vacation when you feel like it. One company I know of that offsets uncounted after hours with uncounted vacation.","Jan 23, 2009","Former"
"Netflix","Senior Software Engineer","Good in the short term, but ...","Netflix pays well to get the best person for the job. The downsides of this are that often people are overqualified for what they are doing, which can lead to a lack of challenge for them.  Worse, Netflix quickly and unceremoniously fires anyone whose skills no longer match the available work, or even whose manager doesn't especially like them. Retraining people for different jobs just doesn't occur. 

If the immediate work fits your professional goals, Netflix can be a good place to work, but don't plan on a long career there.","Netflix's top management has a simple and well thought out strategic vision which they communicate well to employees. The company is consistently profitable and salaries tend to be substantially above the market rates.","Dec 13, 2008","Former"

My point is that if you can make good hiring process then you should not be talking about it in an interview. HR is given unreasonable super power and they try to act as super smart for no reason.

They claim to give higher salaries as opposed to other bay area companies but that amount is nothing if you really compare with other companies. I think any company which relies too much on HR for scaring candidates and keeping them in loop regarding performance of candidates is not a good company for engineers and that company is not the most coveted in bay area.

People are hard working but they are certainly not the smartest. Some are smart as in any other company so I dont understand why they create so much of hooplah.","Good salary (but even though u get few thousand more..it is not worth it)","Aug 11, 2011","Current"

"Netflix","Senior Software Engineer","Netflix is not for everybody","Netflix has very strange politics, because people's jobs are at the whim of their manager.  In other words, if a manager decides that a particular report is no longer a ""star,"" he or she will get a package.  So, given that employees are not stupid, there is a lot of kissing up, resulting in a lot of comedy.  Netflix believes in ""360 feedback,"" but everybody I know only does that to their peers, and they become very political with their management chain.","The best part about Netflix is that they try to pay 20% more than everybody else, so the compensation is good.  They are not shy about spending money, so travel is business class, you'll get a new MacBook Pro every year, etc.  The people there tend to be very nice, the catered lunch is delicious, and so forth.  While there is still a lot of action in Los Gatos building the technology (although arguably it is becoming mature, as streaming is a commodity), the real drama is in Los Angeles, relating to content.","May 22, 2019","Current"
"Netflix","Senior Software Engineering Manager","Weaponization of culture","Most teams aren't working on anything very innovative. The tech is your standard microservices architecture, and everything gets open-sourced, with a blog post and a nice conference talk. Eventually these projects wither because no one maintains them, and sometimes they don't even solve very effectively the problems they tout, but it's good PR for the engineers and 'leaders'.

Culture of fear is real. My manager was toxic, he loved to talk about diversity even though he was the biggest mansplainer in the room. My interview was interesting, it was a monologue of his rather unique theories of engineering management, most of which was a bunch of gibberish culled from the culture deck. When I got there I found him to be a pretty ineffective manager. He didn't have any engineering vision, no idea of strategy, and wasn't technical. If you get into an interview room and the manager spends 45 mins talking about himself, that's probably a sign to run!

Pick and choose what team you join. You can have either a pretty cool time with some smart folks, or have to deal with narcissists who believe their own PR.

"Netflix","Senior Software Engineer","One of the best companies to work for, one of the worst company to work for","-Innovation is dying at this company. If you compare what the product was in 2011 vs. now, they are mostly playing with video playback in the UI and minor features. Probably the reason being, everyone wants to keep their job and want to have as many projects to continue.
- Does lot of A/B testing, even for minor text changes. I'm glad they are not in hardware business else would have ruined the company. Felt product team is good, but not sure about what is right and don't have gut feeling on any thing. 
- Engineering teams competes with each other to build tools. Sometimes the work done for 9 months is thrown because other team built tool with cutting-edge technology.
 - Freedom and responsibility is there but it all depends upon on your leader &  how much he allows to exercise it.
- NIH within team syndrome.
- Managers are sometimes pain and always want to build their 'own' team with 'own' people which discourages existing team.
- IF you are looking for growth in the team, be careful of which team you are joining. 
- Favoritism is there and if the Mgr is really bad with employees, but good with his boss, he will get promoted. 360 only matters from peers and not from whom you manage.
- Can't raise question on why we are doing this.If you are not aligned with manager's vision, sorry but you will get axed soon based on ground of technical imcompetency.
- They try lots of recommendation A/B tests and merch logic but they are not sure if people will watch the title or not.

Ultimately they need to realize they are streaming company which has value in only 1 thing : Content. If you build great product but content is not effective, you are relying on product and not content to sell. If rivals catch up on product , its an issue.","- Great Base pay.

"Netflix","Senior Software Engineer","The best job I've had, and at times, the worst job I've had","The high salary leads some people to ramp up their lifestyles, they then become dependent on being here. This in turn creates a culture of fear where people are constantly stressing out that they are ""not doing enough"" and might be fired any minute. This also extends to the directors of teams, and when your management is stressed, it will always trickle down to create a lousy experience for you.
This makes for an extremely toxic environment at times where teams are often working on similar projects, thus competing against each other to stay relevant, which is just utter idiocy. The high pay ensures that there is way more politicking than would be needed or appropriate in such situations. This in turn can have a very demoralizing effect on the peons doing the actual work, who often feel compelled to work on nights, weekends and public holidays for goals that are often vague, and projects that are often shelved. The most insidious effect of this is observed when people contemplate taking PTO, when many employees have told me that they weren't able to relax or take as much time off as they needed, as they were constantly wondering what would happen to their jobs, and whether or not they were doing enough to ""deserve"" time off. If you've never felt this, it's a rotten state of mind, and you will feel it quite a bit here.
Many times, I've felt the need to quit the field altogether, but the money and my team makes me stay for now, so I'll likely stay till my team changes.

Moral of the story here is: You'll get paid a lot. You'll also likely be laid off sooner than you expect. You'll also likely make a LOT less at your next place. Adjust for your standard of living appropriately so you can keep your head above the circus fray, and don't get used to the good things.","Netflix has some great pros. You'll be working with mostly extremely competent people. Dealing with teams within the company is extremely easy, as most people are very helpful and efficient. They pay you a lot of money, and give you perks like free food, paid cell phone bill, 401k, etc. This is all great, but for me, the biggest draw is always people, and your team will make or break your experience here, so make sure you know what you are getting into at the interview, and don't accept jobs with teams that you don't feel excited about being part of.","Jul 8, 2016","Current"
